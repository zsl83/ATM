ATM

This Java code represents a simple ATM user interface with language selection, password entry, and main page functionality. Here's a breakdown of the code you provided:

1. **Setting Up Pages:**  
   - Different pages are created using JPanels to represent various stages of the ATM interaction, such as language selection, password entry, main page, etc.
   
2. **Designing Components on Pages:**  
   - The components like buttons, labels, and text fields are added to each panel, styled with specified fonts, colors, and sizes.
   - Each component is positioned using bounds within its panel, ensuring proper layout.

3. **Button Actions:**  
   - ActionListeners are added to buttons to handle user interactions. For example, clicking on the language buttons transitions to the password entry page.
   - The "Back" button functionality allows users to navigate back to the previous page.

4. **Transitioning between Pages:**  
   - By adjusting the bounds of the panels and removing/adding the needed panels to the frame, the user interface progresses through the different ATM stages.

5. **Main Page Functionalities:**  
   - Buttons for actions like "Get Cash," "Card Transfer," "Check Inventory," and "Change Password" are added to the main page.
   - Each button is designed with specific properties and added to the third panel for user interaction.

This structure shows the progression of pages and the design of components within each page, enabling users to navigate through language selection, password entry, and main ATM functionalities.
